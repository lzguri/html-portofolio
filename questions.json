Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are the primary pathogens responsible for endocarditis. In contrast, <span class='highlight'>cefepime</span> provides broad-spectrum coverage against <span class='highlight'>Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. An alternative combination of antibiotics to consider is vancomycin with ceftriaxone.

While atrial fibrillation is a concerning arrhythmia, it is not uncommon for infection to trigger atrial fibrillation, particularly in older patients, though it is less typical in younger individuals."

While nafcillin or cefazolin would be excellent options for MSSA, it is premature to make this switch. Daptomycin covers MRSA, but the patient is already adequately covered with vancomycin."

In the context of infective endocarditis (IE), the production of rheumatoid factor can lead to false-positive anti-HCV results. The next appropriate step is to check HCV RNA.
