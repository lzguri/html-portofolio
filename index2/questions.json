He reports a long-standing history of intermittent abdominal pain over several months, localized to the lower abdomen. The pain is described as sharp at times and dull at others. He also reports alternating episodes of diarrhea and normal stools, with persistent rectal bleeding for several months. He denies fever but notes decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Two days prior to presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, prompting him to seek evaluation in the emergency department. A chart review revealed a prior ED visit approximately one year ago for unrelated symptoms, during which routine laboratory testing incidentally identified anemia. The patient denies any NSAID use.",
