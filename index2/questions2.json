  "rightChoice": 4,
  "explanation": "The presence of ulcerated polyps and a partially obstructing colonic mass strongly suggests colorectal carcinoma. Given the potential for advanced disease, particularly with the risk of obstruction and ongoing blood loss, expeditious evaluation is warranted. Two approaches may be considered: <br>1) Immediate staging with a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for metastatic disease.<br> 2) Await definitive histopathological confirmation before proceeding with staging investigations.<br> Due to the potential for rapid disease progression and the risk associated with the partial obstruction, immediate staging is recommended to facilitate timely management.",
